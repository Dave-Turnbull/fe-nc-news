# NC News Frontend

Works with an [NC News backend server](https://github.com/Dave-Turnbull/nc-news) to fetch and display articles on a frontend web app.

When loading the app, please wait for the backend api to spin up. The delay is a limitation of the hosting platform and could take around 1 minute.

Minimum node required: v21.6.0
